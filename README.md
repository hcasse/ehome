# ehome
EHome (for Electronic Home) is a web tool used to manage home servers (to keep your data at home).


# For testing

This variable needs to be set:

	PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:SOURCEPATH

With `SOURCEPATH` the top directory path of **ehome** sources.

Set the variables,

* `EHOME_ROOT` = _some directory_ -- to use configuration/data based on this directory.

* `EHOME_ADMIN` = `yes` -- to avoid login phase.
